# Echo

-   echo is a PHP statement used to output text, variables, or HTML to the browser.
-   -   Use: Display messages, HTML content, or variable values.
-   -   Case insensitive.
-   -   Multiple echo in a single line.
-   -   line break in echo - use <br> tag

# Variable

-   A variable in PHP is a container that stores data (like numbers, strings, arrays).

# Variable Rules

-   Start with $ sign.
-   First character after $ must be a letter or underscore (\_).
-   Cannot start with a number.
-   Only letters, numbers, and underscores allowed (no spaces or special symbols).
-   Case-sensitive ($name ≠ $Name).
-   Must be assigned before use.

# PHP with HTML

1. Why we need PHP & HTML together:

-   -   HTML → Structures the web page (headings, text, forms, images).
-   -   PHP → Adds logic and dynamic content (processes forms, connects database, shows data).
-   -   Together → Create dynamic websites (login systems, blogs, e-commerce).
-   -   HTML alone is static; PHP makes it interactive and connected to backend.
-   -   Example: HTML form takes input, PHP processes and stores it in a database.

2. php write inside the html --> write php inside HTML tags
