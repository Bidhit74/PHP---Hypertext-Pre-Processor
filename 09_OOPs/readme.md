# Object-Oriented Programming System.

-   It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code in a reusable, modular, and organized way.

# 🔹 Main Concepts of OOPs

-   🔹Class → Blueprint/template for creating objects.

-   🔹Object → Instance of a class (real-world entity).

-   🔹Encapsulation → Binding data and methods together in a single unit (class).

-   🔹Abstraction → Hiding internal details, showing only necessary info.

-   🔹Inheritance → One class can use properties & methods of another class.

-   🔹Polymorphism → Same function name used in different ways.
