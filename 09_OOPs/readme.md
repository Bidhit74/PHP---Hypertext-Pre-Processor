# Object-Oriented Programming System.

-   It is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure code in a reusable, modular, and organized way.

# 🔹 Main Concepts of OOPs

-   🔹Class → Blueprint/template for creating objects.

-   🔹Object → Instance of a class (real-world entity).

-   🔹Encapsulation → Binding data and methods together in a single unit (class).

-   🔹Abstraction → Hiding internal details, showing only necessary info.

-   🔹Inheritance → One class can use properties & methods of another class.

-   🔹Polymorphism → Same function name used in different ways.

# Access Modifiers in PHP (OOPs)

-   Access modifiers decide kahan se property/method ko access kar sakte ho.

Modifier -- Same Class -- Child Class -- Outside Class
Public ----- ✅ Yes ------ ✅ Yes ------- ✅ Yes
Protected -- ✅ Yes ------ ✅ Yes ------- ❌ No
Private ---- ✅ Yes ------ ❌ No -------- ❌ No

# Member Variable

-   Class ke andar declare kiya gaya variable jo object ka data store karta hai.
-   Inhe object ke through access kiya jata hai (using $this-> inside class, and -> operator outside).

# Member Function

-   Member function = methods of a class.

-   Ye functions class ke andar define hote hain.

-   Inka kaam hota hai member variables (properties) ko use ya modify karna.

-   Inhe object ke through call kiya jata hai.
