# PHP---Hypertext-Pre-Processor

I am Bidhit Chaudhary, and I am learning PHP.

# How PHP Works 🖥️

-   Browser Request → User opens a .php page (e.g., index.php).
-   Web Server Receives → Apache/Nginx gets the request.
-   PHP Interpreter Runs → Server passes .php file to PHP engine.
-   PHP Code Executes → PHP processes the code (connects DB, applies logic, etc.).
-   Generates HTML Output → PHP converts result into plain HTML.
-   Browser Displays → HTML is sent back to browser for display.

📌 Important: Browser never sees PHP code, only the HTML output.
