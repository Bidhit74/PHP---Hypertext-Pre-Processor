# 1. GET Method

-   Data is sent through the URL.

-   Less secure, visible in the browser.

-   Good for search queries, not for passwords.

# 2. POST Method

-   Data is sent hidden in the request body, not in the URL.

-   More secure than GET, best for login forms.

# $\_REQUEST in PHP

-   $\_REQUEST is a superglobal array in PHP.

-   It collects form data sent with GET, POST, or COOKIE methods.

-   It works as a combined way to access data without checking whether it came from GET or POST.
